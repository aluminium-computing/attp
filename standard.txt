ATTP®

(Aim Text Transfer Protocol)

Status of this document

Current Status: Approved Standard

Status Date: July 7, 2013

Protocol Version: 1.0

Goal

To transfer text over the Aim City Network.

Network Layer

ATTP runs on TCP on port 4779.

Connection Setup

Connect on port 4779 to the desired ATTP server.

The server's response will be

ATTP\<ver> Connection Established

Where <ver> is the protocol version number implemented by the server, without dots. The server will then wait for a command from the client (see Client Commands) before making any further response.

After a Client Command is run, the connection will stay open except if the command is EXIT, or if it is FETCH and its response is 121 Server Busy.

If the server does not understand the client command it returns the following message:

ATTP\<ver> 126 Unknown Command

Where <ver> is the protocol version number implemented by the server, without dots.

Client Commands
FETCH

Syntax:

FETCH <path> ATTP\<ver>

Where

    <path> is a / separated path indicating the location of a file or directory in the server's serving directory (server root dir).

    <ver> is the protocol version number implemented by the client, without dots.


Responses:

ATTP\<ver> <response_code> <response_desc>

[

<32-char random string>

optional_data_body

<32-char random string>

]

    <ver> is the protocol version number implemented by the server, without dots

    response_code response_desc are listed below

    If the response implies a data body, the first line will be a 32-char random string. The actual data body will be all bytes sent until the same string is sent again.


Responses:

    100 OK
    Indicates that the requested file was found and its contents follows in the optional_data_body as described above.

    101 Is A Directory
    Indicates that the requested "file" was found, but is a directory and a directory listing (equivalent to an ENIX® `ls` command in the directory) follows in the optional_data_body as described above.

    121 Server Busy
    Indicates that the server has too many active connections to serve the file or directory. Does not send an optional_data_body. After error, server closes connection.
